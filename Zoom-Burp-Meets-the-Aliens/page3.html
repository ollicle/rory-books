    <h1>Zoom Burp Meets the Aliens – Page 3</h1>
    <p>
     So I thought to call the government. When I did I saw a flying saucer out the window with something looking very weird inside it. 
      I did see a human in there with handcuffs on. I saw they had a badge. 
      I saw the aliens taking it off and throwing it in the bin that looked like a toilet.
      Then I realised it was a toilet. It had a price tag on it. I don’t mean any old price tag. The badge cost a million thousand dollars.

      Then the person was put in jail. That person looked very familiar. Then I saw the flying saucer flying away.
      On the back I saw the word “Capture People”. I said, “Oh no”. I was starting to think it wasn’t the government.
      I was starting to think it was the Police.

    <p>
      Why would the Police capture my dad? He didn’t do anything wrong. 
      Maybe my mum told him off for something and he might be stuck at my mum’s house.
      Maybe that was the case.
    </p>
    <p>
      Okay now I will walk to my mum’s house, but where were those keys?
