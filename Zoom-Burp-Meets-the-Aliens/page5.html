     So he ran inside and thought and thought and thought and thought and thought. But nothing worked.
    </p>
    <p>
     So he decided to do something. But he really didn't know. So he tried to think. Ummmmmmmmmm. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Ummmmmmmmmm. So he thought he had gone on a holiday. But he didn't know how to get to a holiday.

      So he decided to try again at getting through his back door. This time he only saw one alien, but this alien had a weird sort of sword. He decided to hide behind the back door until the alien got bored and fell asleep.

      This alien wasn't a normal alien. He didn't sleep normally. He slept in the sewers. He had snails in his hair and dirty toenails and he washed every ten years. Worst of all, he smelled like dog poo!
