    <h1>Zoom Burp Meets the Aliens – Page 2</h1>
    <p>
     He decided to check his calendar to see what date it was. When he did, he realised it was July the seventh. 
      “Oh goody”, Burp said. 
      Okay, I’ll go and drink a hot milk and honey in my bedroom and 
      think about what has been mysterious in the week and what I will get for my birthday and write it on my birthday list
      and then give my birthdat list to my dad Ted.
    </p>
    <p>
      So he decided to start with his birthday list. 
      He started by writing number one “Chocolate”.
      Number two he wrote “A new coat with buttons”.
      Number three he wrote his favourite super hero star ”Iron sharpens iron metal star”.
      He finished and walked to his dad’s bedroom where he expected to find him in bed.

      Ted was nowhere to be seen, but there was something in his bed. It was a tracker. He picked it up without looking at it.
      He went back to his bedroom and slammed the door behind him. 
      Then he saw the screen was smashed. He saw the buttons, he didn’t know what they meant. 
      The button up the top said “Titan” and the button to the left said “Deimos”
      and the one to the right said “Phobos”. 
    </p>
    <p>
      He didn’t know any of the words, but he guessed the government had just given his dad a silly note.
      I was so mad if it was the government, but I wasn’t mad because I like mysteries and this is a mystery, so it is cool.
